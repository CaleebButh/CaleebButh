### Hello!
My name is caleb! Im currently a CS student studying at southern new hampshire university online.
Im currently creating a discord bot for general use in one of my discord servers. 
A couple of my hobbies, (Aside from coding), include hiking, mountain biking, and gaming. 
I am currently working on a game called "Text souls" With some of my friends. The idea behind it is a "Text-based souls-like game" With real time combat, where your only defense is how fast you can type.
